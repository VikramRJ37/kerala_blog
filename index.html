            <p>I’m someone who loves exploring new places and experiencing different cultures through travel. Whether it’s a road trip, a nature escape, or discovering hidden gems in a city, I enjoy the adventure and the stories that come with it. When I’m not traveling, you’ll probably find me immersed in the world of games. I enjoy playing a variety of games — they help me relax, think strategically, and have fun. Life for me is all about balancing curiosity, creativity, and joy in everything I do.</p>

        <h3>Wayanad</h3>
        <h3>2024 | MAY</h3>
        <p>Wayanad is a slice of paradise hidden in the hills of Kerala. My trip there was a refreshing blend of nature, history, and peace. The journey through winding roads surrounded by dense forests set the tone for what was to come.

        One of the highlights was visiting Edakkal Caves, where ancient carvings whispered stories from thousands of years ago. The climb was a bit challenging but totally worth it. I also explored Pookode Lake, a serene freshwater lake where boating felt like floating through a painting. Soochipara Waterfalls was another unforgettable stop — standing at the base with the water roaring down was energizing.

        The cool climate, greenery all around, and the gentle mist in the mornings made it feel like I was living inside a travel postcard. Wayanad offered both adventure and calm — a perfect mix.</p>

        <h3>Munnar</h3>
        <h3>2025 | JUNE</h3>
        <p>Munnar was like stepping into a dream filled with rolling tea gardens and cool mountain air. As I entered the hill station, the sight of endless green plantations stretching across hills took my breath away. The aroma of fresh tea leaves, the sounds of chirping birds, and the fog drifting over the roads made every moment feel magical.
        I visited Eravikulam National Park, home to the endangered Nilgiri Tahr, and the views from the top were simply stunning. The Tea Museum gave me a glimpse into how Munnar’s famous tea is made, and the visit ended with a steaming cup of fresh tea — nothing beats that!
        The sunrise at Top Station and the misty beauty of Mattupetty Dam were picture-perfect. Munnar wasn’t just a destination; it was an experience that calmed the mind and lifted the soul.</p>
